Overdrive/Distortion

## Features

- Distortion Pedal simulation. 

MetalTone is modeled after the renowned BOSS MT-2 Metal Zone(*), a high gain distortion pedal with an advanced EQ section.

It has standard active EQ controls with a massive 15dB of cut/boost range for the lows and highs.
It also sports a parametric active EQ for the mids with two controls: the frequency, and the boost/cut amount.

The midfreq parameter has a very wide range, going from 200Hz all the way to 5kHz. As a result, it's better to think of it simply as a single highly flexible active EQ, 
and disregard the idea that it's only for shaping the mids.
